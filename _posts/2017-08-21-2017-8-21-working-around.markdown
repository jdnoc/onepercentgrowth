## There's Something I Have Noticed Lately

I work better when I'm not in the same place all day. 

Today I got more done than I have in a long time - in less time. 

I spent my first hour outside, under the tent, at a picnic table, answering emails. Then, I worked in the cafeteria.
Then I worked at my desk. 

I want to experiment with different areas. I find the new environments stimulating and inspirational. When I sit at my 
desk all day, I get into old bad habits. When I am in more public areas, with more accountability and accessibility,
it helps me focus on what I am doing.

## I Simply Cannot Sit At My Desk All Day

It's bad for everything. I need to batch my time, spending as much time is needed in a different area, in order to 
get one major task done.

I'm figuring out what works for me, and what doesn't. Right now, working at my desk is just simply not working. I can't seperate tasks and I 
can't focus on one singular thing.
