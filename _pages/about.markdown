## One Percent Growth is actionable advice for people who want to grow.

Hey there, I'm Jordan O'Connor. I'm currently working a cubicle job at a large corperation,
but I plan on being an entreprenuer as soon as I can.

This blog is an experiment - to find a process of editing habits that touch every fiber of our being
over the course of a year and fundamentaly changing who we are. I haven't decided what I'll call it yet,
but Habit Editing sounds cool.

I'm working on cool stuff such as:

1. [Blacklet](https://blacklet.com) - the black paper notebook for creatives.
2. A Marketing and SEO firm (soon to be announced).
3. Being a dad!
