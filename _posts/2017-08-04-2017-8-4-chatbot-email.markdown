I needed to write today - I've got a lot on my mind.

If you snooped around, you'd know that I am [launching a kickstarter](https://blacklet.com) soon.

I'm at odds with how to collect leads. Traditional email marketing? Or the Chatbot landgrab?

I think the best choice is Chatbots - simply because of the integration with Facebook.

The major attraction to email is the fact that is very matrure. There are a lot of programs out there that 
support email marketing efforts, like referrals, competitions and giveaways. 

But Chatbots, oh Chatbots, it's never been easier to get in front of someone's eyes. There's no
cluttered inbox to sift through. There's no barrier to entry, no typing, no confirmation email. It's
as simple as it can get to get started.

But it's super new. And it's super unstable. I have no idea what the ROI will be, and how affective the campaign will be.

I have little to no idea how to get people to share the bot (other than getting them to share my page). This is a major thing for me.

There are plenty of referral tools for email - but little to none for chatbots. 

One major, major advantage of chatbots, is the ability to message people who comment on a post (with a specific word). 

I just want this to work so bad that I don't want to mess it up. I think it's a really good idea, and I'd hate for
all of my mistakes to have been pointed back to this decision.

Then again, if it works, I know it will work well (the chatbots, that is). So what if my massive success is the
result of chatbots?

Today I have everything pointing to the chatbots. We'll run some ads and such soon and see hwo it performs there as well.

PS: I love [ChatFuel](https://chatfuel.com).
