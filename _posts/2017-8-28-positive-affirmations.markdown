## "Say This With Me"

> Say this with me: God Has Delivered Me, Even From Things That I Have Caused. - **Dr. Gene Lingerfelt**

My family has lately been in somewhat of a rut. Bills keep coming in and money keep oging out, and rarely do we see increase.

But that's not what I am supposed to say. You see, that's just my current situation. My current situation isn't God's ultimate plan for my life or my family's life.

**My family is always increasing. This month is better than last month. We have more than enough to provide for everything we have.**

## There's a Miracle In Your Mouth

> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. - Proverbs 18:21

The things you say have power, and it doesn't matter if you are speaking life or death.

The things you say about yourself have power. The things you say about your friends have power. 

If you continually speak death to a situation, that is what you will receive every time. 

If you continually speak life and faith to a situation, things will always work out in your favor in the end. 

Last week we were convinced that we needed to get rid of a car to be able to afford everything we need to pay for. After listening to the teachings of Dr. Gene Lingerfelt
we are now convinced that we need to change what we are speaking over our situation.

I want to make a plan that allows us (my wife and I) to recite positive affirmations and faith based claims every morning and evening (maybe afternoon as well?).

We've got to apply faith to everything we do. I believe that we have the power to flip our current situation for good.
