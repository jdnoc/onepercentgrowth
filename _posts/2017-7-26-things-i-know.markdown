## Win The Morning, Win The Day

This is the truth. It's not debatable. The best way to set yourself up for success
is to have a strict blueprint that you follow every morning. This allows you to
get in the right mindset for the day, and stabilize your state. 

## Life Is A Marathon

I'm convicted of this in my own mind when I think about quitting something due to a
lack of effort. Why would you quit in months on something that you want to do for the rest of
your life? The rest of your life. 

I'm 25, let's guess I have 65 years left. I have 65 years
of work, passion, love, and success ahead of me. The things that I do every day will
be the biggest indicator of how I will grow over time.

## Start Small

Every time I try to change a lot of things (habits, 'passions', goals, etc.), I end up going
back to what I call my 'default self'. My default self isn't who I want to be. 

When you start small with goals and changing habits, you slowly change your default self rather than
just changing for that day. When you change your default self, you can rely on your newfound habits. 
That's when success comes to you naturally.

## Journal (write)

I've found this to make the largest impact on my clarity and focus for the day. When I write, 
I let my thoughts do the talking. And when I let them talk, they figure out what they need to
be doing. 

When I have an explicit direction for the day, it's not hard to accomplish what I set out to do.
But when I don't have clarity of mind, I often neglect the things I should be working on for 
other things that I can procrastinate on.

As I'm thinking about what I want to do with this blog - I have a large and long project in mind.
Here's my idea. 

## A Year Of Growth

I want to take a year and change a habit / grow every day.

Since there are 365 days in a year, this can be very gradual. This is a marathon, remember?

There are 12 months in a year, so I want to develop 12 pillars of habits that can be edited.

These can include:

1. Health
2. Fitness
3. Family
4. Spouse
5. Morning Routine
6. Spirituality
7. Reading
8. Producing
9. Meditation
10. Waking Up Earlier
11. Evening Routines
12. Sleeping
13. etc.

I'll add more and cut some from this list, but you get the point.

Then, each month is focussed on editing one of those pillars gradually.

There are roughly 4 weeks in a month, so I will take 4 gradual steps to 
editing that habit.

For example, if the habit is 'Waking Up Earlier', the weeks in the month could look like this:

1. Begin Waking Up at 7 AM
2. Wake Up at 6:30 AM
3. Wake Up at 6 AM
4. Wake up at 5:30 AM

The start and end times could be anything - depending on the person. They can also be more coarse or
gradual depending on how successful they are at making the habit stick (Maybe 4 or 5 days instead of a week).

The object of the pillars, is to have them stick, and you continue to do the previous pillars while 
editing new pillars. 

There is a snag, though, some pillars cannot be done very easily before others. For instance, staying on the
'Waking Up Early' habit - It's nearly impossible to be successful at getting up early if you don't have an
evening routine / good sleep habit.

So, before we can wake up early, we have to sleep well, and that would come first in the program.

And before we can have a morning routine, we have to be waking up early.

And before we can make time for meditation, spirituality, journaling, exercising, etc., we need a morning routine.

So most of this all hinges on sleeping well. The thing we do for more than a third of our lives.

So that's what this is all about. I am going to make a plan, stick to it and write about it's affectiveness.
