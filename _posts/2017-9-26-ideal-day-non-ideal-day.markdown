## Ideal Day

- Run
- Lots Of Water
- Healthy, Low Carb Meals
- Bible Reading
- Play Time with Finn
- Wife Time
- Work that I love (business that I own)
- Tasks Planned
- 8 Hours of Actual Work
- Be With People I Love

## Non-Ideal Day
- No Exercise
- Headache from Lack of Water
- Lots of Carbs (and feeling bloated)
- No Bible / Spiritual Time
- To Tired To Play With Finn
- Just Going To Bed and No Conversations / Intimacy
- Dead-end Day-Job
- Tasks At A Whim
- Only and Hour or Two of Actual Work
- Isolation

The crazy thing is, the non-ideal day is what most days look like for me.

That needs to change.
