## Planning Is My Worst Attribute

For some reason, planning into the future is really hard for me. It's not hard for me to have a vision about what I should be doing in the future, but it's really hard for me to make a schedule and stick to it.

It's almost as if when I am tasked with something, If I can't do it now then I don't do it. I'm very immediate and quick. Very last minute. I'm ultra productive when I feel inclined to be - but utterly useless when I don't have the will power.

There are a lot of things I should be planning that I am not. Things like dates with my wife, financial tracking, fitness goals, and even where my personal endeavors are headed.

I've let the all go to the wind. They happen when they happen. It's really unhealthy.

## I've Dabbled In Trello For Years

I was one of the initial beta testers of Trello. I have admired productivity for a long time - but I never committed to it.
