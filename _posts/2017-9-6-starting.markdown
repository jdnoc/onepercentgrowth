## What happens if I don't feel like prepping or cleaning?

I had it all planned out.

Last night I had my list of things to clean, and things to pack.

I didn't do any of it though. I did work instead.

That's a habit I need to break. Evenings should be for winding down, not working. 

I have all day to spend working and spending my energy. If I don't get this evening routine right I won't be successful in the morning.

Having a successful morning makes it easier to have a successful evening. Having a successful evening makes it easier to have a successful morning.

Somewhere along the line, I have to do it when I don't feel like doing it. That'll be tonight.
