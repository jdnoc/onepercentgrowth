## Consistency Is All I Want

Right now, there are only a few things that are consistent in my life.

I go to work every weekday. I go to church every Wednesday evening and Sunday morning. I go to bed between 10 and 11 and wake up between 5 and 6 (sometimes 7).

Other than that, I don't have a lot of habits floating around. Most days look different. I really want to change that.

## I NEED Exercise

It's a staple that needs to be in my life. 

It's the cornerstone of a lot of things - it increases my water intake and energy, reduces stress, and boosts self-confidence.

I simply can't ignore something that applies to so many things in my life. 

The thing is, where do I fit it in within a day?

I can workout / run at 5 AM. Or, I could do it at 8 PM. That's about it. 

I could do it at work / at the canal at work, or at home.

## Evening Routine

If I were to work out at the canal at work in the mornings, I would need to have a seriously involved evening routine. Which might actually be the thing I need.

I would have to get up at 5 - put on my workout clothes, and walk out the door with my stuff.

I'd get to work at 5:40, and run until 6:20. Then I'd shower and stuff to get me to about 6:45.

I could then plan for the day and make my most important tasks lists. 

Then I could spend 2 - 3 hours on stuff that I need to get done personally.

That puts me at 10 AM. I'd then work until 4 PM.

Then I can come home and initiate my involved evening routine. 

## Spiritual Routine

I want to be getting into the word more. It's something that is long overdue and I need to amplify it if I want to see more personal growth.

I could make that part of my morning routine at work, and part of my evening routine. 

Even a half-hour of my 7 to 10 AM time is enough for right now. 

That, and affirmations / gratefulness exercises. 

I'm just thinking outloud here.
